#### Introduction
For my PhD work, I used ice cores from Antarctica to study periods of Earth's past that were warmer than today. Specifically, I am interested in furthering our understanding of Earth's greenhouse gas history, and the biogeochemical cycles that drive atmospheric changes. Before my PhD, I received a masters in teaching and taught middle school science in Seattle, WA. I remain passionate about k-12 education and science communication. Prior to teaching, I studied oceanography and political science at the University of Washington. While at UW, I gained research excperience in sediment dynamics (Andrea Ogston and Chuck Nittrouer), and paleoceanography (Julian Sachs).
